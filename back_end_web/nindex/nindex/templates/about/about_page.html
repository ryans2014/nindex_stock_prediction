              Time sequence prediction is a challenging machine learning topic.
              Prediction of stock market trend is even harder because the stock price is influenced by unpredictable external events.
              These unpredictable events add noises to the data.
              These noises cannot be learned by the machine learning model because they don't have consistent statistical behaviors.

              This website demonstrates the performance of a <a href="https://github.com/ryansu2011/stock_recommender">project</a>
              in which machine learning algorithms are ultilized to predict US stock market.</p>
            <p>
              This is an ongoing project, which means the numerical model may get updated if study found better data processing method, better model structure, etc.
              Please see the <a href="{% url 'model:model_page' %}">model</a> page for more information.
